Java is more than an island in Indonesia or slang for coffee: It's one of the most popular programming languages in common usage throughout the web. If you're dreaming of a career in software programming, certification in Java is a popular route to establishing recognizable credentials.

Java is very popular because it inherits the tradition and style of C and C++, but is developed with emphasis on simplicity - making it is easier for a beginner to understand. If you're already an expert in C or C++, then Java is almost effortless to learn. Secondly, Java has portability independent of the platform, which means Java can be executed on most computer environments. This has definitely helped Java prevail in gaining an advantage over other languages. Third, Java uses automatic memory management, which automatically clears out garbage for the programmer and retrieves memory. And it's free!

To be an expert in Java, you don't necessarily have to get a college degree. You just need some initiative, a desire to learn and knowledge of the right steps!
