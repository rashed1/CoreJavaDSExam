Please answer the below core-java Questions:


What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
JDK contains Java Runtime Environment which includes Java Virtual Machine. It has different components and some of them following: 

Java Compiler - converts source code into java bytecode
Java Interpreter - interprets class file generated by compiler
Java Disassembler - disassembles class file
Java Documentation - creates documentation from source code comment
Java Debugger - tests and debug java program
Java Applet Viewer - can be used to run and debug Java applet

What is IDE?
-Integrated Development Environment

What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
-Eclipse
intellij
Bluej

Explain the entire java life cycle.
-In the first step, source code is written using a text editor and saved as a .java file. It is then passed to Java compiler which transformed the source code to byte code and creates a .class file. The .class file is loaded to JVM which converts the code to machine understandable language and pass to operating system which present the output of the code.

what is class?
-A class is a blueprint for an object

What is object?
-A class is a blueprint for an object

What is the entry point of an application?

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
In interface class, you can't implement any method but in abstract class you are allowed to implement non-abstract method. 

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
No. 
You use "new" to create an object from an interface and abstract class

what is Access Specifier?
-Access specifier are keywords to set accessibility of classes, methods and variable

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
-Object Oriented Programming 
Abstraction - a way to hide implementation from interface
Encapsulation - is a form of data hiding
Inheritance - is a process by which one object acquires all the properties of parent object 
Polymorphism - is the ability of an object to take on many forms

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
- Application Programming Interface
-File Reader and Buffer Reader

Does java support multiple inheritance?
- No.

What is method overloading and when it happens?
-Method overloading is assigning the same name to multiple methods of a class
-It happens in compile time

What is method overriding and when it happens?
-Method overriding is when a child class changes an exisiting method of a parent class.
It happens in runtime.

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
- An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instruction
- We can use built-in class to class handle exceptions in java. Usually, a try/catch block is used to find the exception and find the error message

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
- "static" keyword is a member of a class that isn’t associated with an instance of a class
-Static variable belongs to the class not to any object
- Static method allows to access class properties without creating an object

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
- "final" keyword is used to prevent changing of values in java
-  final variable's value cannot be changed by local variable or member variable
- final method can't be changed by a child class

What is final, finally and finalize?
-Fianl for a variable sets its value permanently
-Fianlly is a block which is a part of exception handling with try catch which always occurs if the tyr block exists
-finalize is used to call java garbage collector to kill an unused object

What is a constructor ?

Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.65-b01, mixed mode)

What is JAR stand for ?
-Java Archive

What is compile time and run time?
- The source code is compiled into machine code in order to become an executable prgoram. This compilation process is known as compile time. 
Run time is when the executable is run by a user.

What is heap?
- Heap is where objects are loaded in RAM

How java manage it's memory?
-Java has a garbage collector that automatically kills object that is not being used
