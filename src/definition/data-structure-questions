Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:


1) why do we need data structure?
- to be efficient in terms of time and memory when processing large data and solving complex math problem 

2) List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
- Database
- Statistical Analysis
- Numerical Analysis
-Simulation
- Artificial Intelligence

3) what is an Array?
-Array is a container to store data

4) what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
ArrayList can grow dynamically. Array needs to have a limit set when initialized.

5) what is LinkedList?
- Linked list is a linear data structure comprising of a key-value pair

6) what is queue?
-Queue is a data structure concept where first data in is the first out

7) what is stack?
-Stack is a data structure concept where last data in is the first out

8) what is FIFO and LIFO?
- First In First Out
-Last In Last Out

9) what is the order of complexity?
- It measures how many steps it takes to complete a problem in certain way in data structure

10)what is the best case to search an element from an array?
- The best case is when the case is present in the first location searched  

11)what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
- The worst case is when searched case is not present in the data set

12) what is tree in data structure?
A tree is a data structure consisting of nodes organized as a hierarchy

13) what is graph in data structure?
A graph is an array comprised of a set of vertices and a set of edges

14) what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
HashMap is non synchronized and not thread safe.On the other hand, HashTable is thread safe and synchronized

15) What are the major data structures used in the following areas : 
RDBMS - Array,
 Network data model - Graph
 and Hierarchical data model - Trees

16) How HashMap works in java?
HashMap works on the principle of hashing

17)What is Big-(O)-notation?
- Big O notation is used to describe the performance of an algorithm 

18)Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
- Merged sort is better at dealing with large data compared to insertion sort

19) Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of adding element.
  b)In terms of removing element.
  c)In terms of searching element.
